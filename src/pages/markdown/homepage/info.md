text: The first award - an honorary diploma of the international exhibition in Paris - was received by the children's musical film “Beethoven's Concert” to the music of Isaac Dunaevsky. And the highest-grossing Belarusian picture was the youth social drama “My Name is Arlekino” by Valery Rybarev (1987). According to the results of rentals in cinemas in the territory of the former USSR for 15 months, the tape attracted 42 million viewers - this is an absolute record. In second place is Igor Dobrolyubov’s comedy "Belye Rosy" (1983). On the third is the children's adventure film “A Girl Seeks a Father” directed by Lev Golub (1959), which was watched by almost 35.5 million people and shown in 83 countries (an absolute geographical leader!). By the way, a film is considered to be recouped, having gathered at least 16 - 20 million viewers. In the history of our cinema there are few such paintings - about three dozen. In total, the museum’s film library has 550 gaming, 180 animated and about 3,000 documentary films. Many Belarusian paintings won people's love. For example, the lyrical musical comedy “My Love” (1940) has not left the screens of Soviet cinemas for 30 years. For the sake of positive emotions, the audience again and again went to watch a fictional story with a happy end.
